# VNote Styles
VNote supports custom styles for both edit and read modes. The best way to make a custom style is to download the default styles [here](https://github.com/tamlok/vnote/tree/master/src/resources/themes), rename them, put them in the style folder, and tune it to your taste.

A restart is needed to detect a new style. A re-open of current tabs is needed to apply a new style.

For detailed information about a style, please visit [VNote](https://github.com/tamlok/vnote).

## Editor Style
An editor style is a file with suffix `.mdhl`. By default, it locates in subfolder `styles` in VNote's configuration folder.

You could visit [Stylesheets from PEG Markdown Highlight](http://hasseg.org/peg-markdown-highlight/docs/stylesheet_syntax.html) for detailed syntax.

## Read Mode Style
A read mode style is a file with suffix `.css`. By default, it locates in subfolder `styles` in VNote's configuration folder.

### Code Block Style
A code block style is a file with suffix `.css`. By default, it locates in subfolder `styles/codeblock_styles` in VNote's configuration folder.

You could visit [Highlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js) for more styles.
