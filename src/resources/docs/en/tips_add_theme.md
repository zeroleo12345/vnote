# VNote Themes
VNote supports themes. A theme is a folder in the subfolder `themes` in VNote's configuration folder. The best way to make a custom theme is to copy one of the default themes, rename related files, put them in the theme folder, and tune it to your taste.

Please do not modify the default themes directly, or you may lose your changes.

A restart is needed to detect or apply a new theme.

For detailed information about a theme, please visit [VNote](https://github.com/tamlok/vnote).
