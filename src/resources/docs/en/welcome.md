## Troubleshooting Guide
::: alert-info

**How to enable Vim mode?**

Open `Settings` dialog via the `File` menu, then jump to `Read/Edit` tab and you could enable Vim via the combo box in `Key mode`. Restart VNote to take effect.

If you do not know what Vim is, please do not enable it!

VNote could be used in two ways:

1. Note-taking application via notebooks, folders and notes. VNote manages all the data and provides additional functionality such as attachment and tag.
2. Editor. VNote provides the explorer for local file system to open external files to edit.

Steps to troubleshoot:

1. Go through the context menu, menu bar, tool bar, settings, and help menu to check if you miss something;
2. Changes to configuration may need re-opening current tabs or restarting VNote;
3. There is a Markdown guide and shortcuts guide in the help menu, which might be helpful;
4. Do a quick search in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tamlok/vnote/issues) and VNote's [Documentation](https://tamlok.github.io/vnote/en_us/#!docs/_vnote.json);
5. Post an issue *in detail* on GitHub to ask for help.

Now, how about pressing `Ctrl+G` and start today's work from **Universal Entry**?

Have fun!
